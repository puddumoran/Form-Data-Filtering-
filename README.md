# Form-Data-Filtering-
The notebook allows one to filter student responses on the basis of students batch and the club combination they have opted for . 

The main motivation of writing this file orifinated when I was appointed as the coordinator of AI/ML club in my college and had to conduct interviews of various club members . The data consists of google form responses .
Since the data size was humongus couples with the gltches of google forms and my bad experinence with using MS-Excel I decided to to s=test my hold on Pandas .

The csv file consists of the following columns : - { Timestamp , Name , Email Address , Name ,Roll No. ,Branch ,Batch,Contact Number,Institute Mail Id adn Club .

The user is shown all the clubs presenent intechnical board domain and then asks the user what he/she is looking for . The user is asked on which basis of club combiantion that user wants the enteries to be filtered . 
The user is then asked which clubs that he wan the students to be part of . A list showing the names of all the clubs along with a number in front of it is displayed .The user enters the corresponding number(s) .

The user then continue running the remaining code .

Details are divided batch wise i.e. for each batch separate details are given 
The batches that filled the form were :- 2019-2023 , 2020-2024 and 2021-2025 .
Details of each batch is shown and how many of them had opted for hte user chosen club combination . Furthuer filtering on the basis of branch is also done .


The csv file has ot been uploaded yet as the details of the tech board community shall remain confidential  However I will soon uplaod a csv file fo similar format but  with unreal data .
